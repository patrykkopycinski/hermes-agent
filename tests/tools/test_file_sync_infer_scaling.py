"""Performance regression tests for ``_infer_host_path``.

``_infer_host_path`` runs once per synced file and used to walk the whole
mapping, re-running ``_is_upload_only_host_path`` (a filesystem
``Path.resolve()``) for every candidate -- O(files x mappings) filesystem
calls, which dominated ``sync_back`` against a large remote.

The directory index makes the filter run once per mapping entry per sync
instead of once per (file, mapping) pair. These tests pin the call count and
the call-site placement, which are the properties that actually decay, rather
than wall-clock timing.
